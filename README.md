### Punica 3.0 API for Developers
Punica's API-based structure allows you to create or customize a CSS framework to suit your needs and preferences. The ```options.scss``` API file, which contains all the default variables and settings required by Punica, can be customizedâ€”even class names can be modified if desired. Additionally, you can make all these changes directly through your own theme map instead of editing ```options.scss```. You are completely free!
